# ECHome

Deploy cloud images to your local home network for ultra fast provisioning of linux instances. ECHome allows you to bring some of the convenient cloud features such as cloud-init user-data scripts on boot, SSH key insertion, VM snapshots and image creation.

This is a work-in-progress and not fully deployable yet from this repo.
