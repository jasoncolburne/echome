# ecHome Web API - Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for interfacing to the ecHome API. Once your server is setup, you'll be able to follow through the guide to make requests to the server and begin building virtual machines.

> ℹ️ If you're looking to get started quickly, the CLI is the best way to start interacting with ecHome. The documentation for the CLI can be [found here](https://github.com/mgtrrz/echome-cli).


The examples in this guide use `curl` to show how to structure the requests and may be translated to other language-specific libraries. If you're working within Python, consider using the [echome-python-sdk](https://github.com/mgtrrz/echome-python-sdk/) module as it wraps all of the API calls for you.

## Prerequisites

- An ecHome server that is running.
- An account and user created.
- A user access key and secret. This is required to authenticate with the server.
