# ecHome - Virtual Machines

Virtual Machine management is the primary feature of ecHome. There's a couple of components of the virtual machines that you'll need to become familiar with.

## Components

* Image: A file that contains all information needed to produce a virtual machine. These images can either be in the form of a cloud image where linux or Windows is already installed or a disk image where installation 

* Guest Machine Image (`gmi`): These are images that can be used by all tenants of the cluster.

* Virtual Machine Image (`vmi`): These are images created by users that have been customized from the Guest Machine Image and are only accessible to the same account.
